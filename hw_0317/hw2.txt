- PCA
Principal components are defined as sequence of unit vectors where
1) the vectors are orthogonal on each other,
2) distances between the data and each vectors are minimized.
PCA is to extract the principal components and change basis,
also commonly used for dimension reduction.

PCA can be processed as:
1) Center the data by subtracting the mean.
2) Compute the covariance matrix, further calculate 
  eigenvalues/eigenvectors from the covariance matrix.
3) sort the eigenvectors by its eigenvalue and select the top N vectors,
  where N corresponds to the output dimension.
4) multiply the eigenvectors to get reduced output.

Details can be found in pca.py.

- LDA
Linear discriminant analysis is to find a linear combination of 
features that separates classes.
