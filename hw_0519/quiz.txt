- similarites of WaveNet, SampleRNN and WaveRNN
All three models are auto-regressive model; they depend on their previous output.
Their inputs are time-domain raw samples. For WaveNet and SampleRNN,
both models are of hierarchical structure, which can efficiently model
the long dependencies among the samples. For SampleRNN and WaveRNN,
both model utilizes recurrent layer as their components.

- differences between WaveNet and SampleRNN
One of the biggest difference would be that WaveNet is based on
convolutional networks, whereas SampleRNN is based on recurrent networks.
On WaveNet, dilated convolution is used to further increase the receptive
field of the model, whereas on SampleRNN different tiers of levels from sample level
to frame level covers variety range of the given input.

- differences between SampleRNN and WaveRNN
On SampleRNN, each sample is generated with respect to the hierarchical
depdencies upon the previous samples using multi-layer RNN. In WaveRNN,
single-layer RNN is used and instead, dual soft max is used to estimate a sample.
Batch sample generation by subscaling of the given sequence enables WaveRNN
to be decoded faster.

- differences between WaveNet and WaveRNN
As the differences between WaveNet and SampleRNN, unline WaveNet having 
convolutional layers as its main component, SampleRNN consists of recurrent layer.
Also, as in the differences between SampleRNN and WareRNN, hierarchical layer is used
within WaveNet whereas WaveRNN utilizes single recurrent layer with dual softmax and
subscaling.
