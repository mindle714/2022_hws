- Toy example
toy.py can be used to generate gmm with given number of mixtures(--num-mixture option).
toy-$1-$2.png contains pair of contour/3d-surface describing the gaussian mixtures.
$1 stands for the number of mixtures used and
$2 is 100*likelihood of the training data under the gmm.

In toy.py, data is sampled from three different distributions:
1) mean [5.,5.], covariance [[1.,-1.],[-1.,3.]]
2) mean [-1.,2.], covariance [[2.,1.],[1.,1.]]
3) mean [-5.,-5.], covariance [[3.,0.],[0.,3.]]
The likelihood increases rapidly until the number of mixtures match
the number of sampling distributions; the difference becomes gradual after the point.

- Speaker identification
Speakers used for train/test are listed in spk.list, 20 males and 20 females.
Feature extraction is done using ext_feat.py.
Training and evaluation are done with spk_id.py.
Detailed options used can be found in run_spk_id.
