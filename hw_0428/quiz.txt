- Squeeze-and-Excitation(SE) network
SE network is a network which converts input feature into
statistic feature and excite the aggregated statistic feature.
Say, given input feature of size [H x W x C],
channel-wise statistics can be aggregated with global average pooling.
By the pooling, the height and width information is all averaged
onto the single skewed [C] vector. This step is called squeeze.
On excitation step, the skewed statistic features are broadcast
to the original input feature and they are multiplied
(channel-wise multiplication) so that the output feature is of same size with input.
By applying squeeze-and-excitation, channel-wise informations
are aggregated onto the output matrix.

- Depthwise separable convolution
Depthwise separable convolution is a kind of convolution
that seprates vanilla convolution into depthwise convolution and
pointwise convolution, also well known as 1x1 convolution.
At depthwise convolution, each channel plane of given input [H x W] 
is regareded as the separate input feature of channel 1 [H x W x 1]
so that the convolution is applied on each plane.
At pointwise convolution, the channelwise information aggregation occurs.
with kernel size of 1 x 1, the pointwise convolution defines affine
operation on each channel dimension.
By separating the original convolution into two, great deal of 
complexity savings occur.
